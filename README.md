# deepmip_database_app
Interactive app for DeepMIP model-data comparison built with streamlit.

Test the current version at: https://data.deepmip.org

**The app is currently in development and should not be used to extract data for any publication!**

The website is a collection of Python functions that are designed to easily interact with the upcoming open-access release of the DeepMIP-Eocene database (https://www.deepmip.org/data-eocene/). Users with no prior programming experience are able to extract common variables (temperature, precipitation, ...) from all eight DeepMIP models at any given location. The results can be visualised and downloaded in CSV format for an easy offline model-data comparison. Individual Python functions might also be used as a starting point for a more sophisticated analysis.
