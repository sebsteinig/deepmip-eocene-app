    The **D**eep **T**ime **M**odel **I**ntercomparison **P**roject (DeepMIP)-Eocene
    is a collaboration of eight climate modelling groups from around the world, 
    each carrying out standardised simulations of the early Eocene climate optimum 
    (EECO, âˆ¼ 50 million years ago). All generated data is freely available to
    everyone. This website provides an interface to extract point data from all available 
    simulations, as well as information on how to dowbload the global model data.

    ###  How to Get Started
    Select any of the following pages to start your analysis:

    - <a href='Download_global_model_data' target='_self'>Download global model data</a> from the CEDA Archive.
    - <a href='Extract_local_model_data' target='_self'>Extract local model data</a> for any location, ready to be imported into your spreadsheet.
    - <a href='Plot_local_model_data' target='_self'>Plot local model data</a> (monthly, seasonal, annual) and it's relation to CO$_2$ and global mean temperature.
    - <a href='Map_sites_and_boundary_conditions' target='_self'>Map sites and boundary conditions</a> to see how your sites are represented in different models.
