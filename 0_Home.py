    The **D**eep **T**ime **M**odel **I**ntercomparison **P**roject (DeepMIP)-Eocene
    is a collaboration of eight climate modelling groups from around the world, 
    each carrying out standardised simulations of the early Eocene climate optimum 
    (EECO, âˆ¼ 50 million years ago). All generated data is freely available to
    everyone. There are two main ways to access the data:
    1. This website provides an interface to extract point data from all available 
    simulations for quick and easy and comparison with local proxy data.
    2. The full database (size: ...) can be downloaded from the CEDA Archive (link)
    to follow.

    ###  How to Get Started
    Select any of the following pages to start your analysis:

    - <a href='Extract_model_data' target='_self'>Extract model data</a> for any location, ready to be imported into your spreadsheet.
    - <a href='Plot_model_data' target='_self'>Plot model data</a> (monthly, seasonal, annual) and it's relation to CO$_2$ and global mean temperature.
    - <a href='Paleogeography' target='_self'>Create paleogeographic maps </a> for your site and see how it is represented in different models.
